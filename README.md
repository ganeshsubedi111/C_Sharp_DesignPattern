# Design Pattern in C#

The Design Pattern are simply the reusable solution to the problem which we were facing everyday in our programming
Design  pattern are generally used for solving the problems of object creation and implementation. Design pattern are basically treated as templates.

## There are 23 design patterns .In C#, 23 design patterns are categorized into three main groups: 

 ## 1. Creational
 These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, optimizing and abstracting the instantiation process.

### Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point.
### Factory Method: Defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects created.
### Abstract Factory: Provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying concrete classes.
### Builder: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
### Prototype: Creates new objects by copying an existing object (clone).

## 2. Structural Design Pattern 
These patterns focus on class composition, simplifying the relationships between entities.

### Adapter: Bridges incompatible interfaces by wrapping an existing class with a new interface.
### Bridge: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to evolve independently.
### Composite: Treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly (tree structures).
### Decorator: Dynamically adds behavior to objects without modifying their code.
### Facade: Provides a simplified interface to a larger, more complex system.
### Flyweight: Optimizes memory usage by sharing common object states.
### Proxy: Provides a placeholder for another object to control access to it.

## 3. Behavioral
These patterns focus on communication between objects and the delegation of responsibilities.

### Chain of Responsibility: Passes requests through a chain of handlers until one handles it.
### Command: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization and queuing of requests.
### Interpreter: Defines a language grammar and an interpreter to process expressions.
### Iterator: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its structure.
### Mediator: Centralizes communication between different objects, reducing their direct dependencies.
### Memento: Captures an objectâ€™s state for undo operations.
### Observer: Defines a dependency between objects, notifying observers of state changes.
### State: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
### Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable.
### Template Method: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, allowing subclasses to customize steps.
### Visitor: Separates algorithms from object structures by defining new operations on them.

# Other Patterns in C#

###  Dependency Injection (DI): Manages dependencies by injecting them instead of creating them inside a class.
### MVC (Model-View-Controller): Separates the application logic (Model), UI (View), and control flow (Controller), commonly used in ASP.NET.
